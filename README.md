This is a project for class Exploratory Data Analysis/Visualizations in Columbia University. Our team presents interactive visualizations and interesting insights into the Airbnb data. We like choosing Airbnb for accommodations when traveling because of their low cost, convenient location, and household amenities. We focus on New York Cityâ€™s data because we live in New York and we love this amazing city, we wish to perform an in-depth analysis on one of the most popular popular tourist destinations in the world.
